# Quick Introduction
This is part of model in Qualityum App. Qualityum is an application for classify quality and durability of fruits.
We divide it to 2 part of model machine learning : model to quality classification and durability 

# Machine learning model for quality classification :
1. We are using google colab and tensorflow 2.5.0 version to build the model. 
2. Make sure to download/prepare dataset. Our source of dataset is from kaggle and IEEE.
   But we already provide zip file in drive : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s0mHiO3wF_shUHO8NwjytBD1svWAFSr_/view?usp=sharing
3. You can follow the step in each file (starts with collecting data, exploring dataset & preprocessing, build model from baseline and explore to get improvement in accuracy or maybe to solve overfitting).
